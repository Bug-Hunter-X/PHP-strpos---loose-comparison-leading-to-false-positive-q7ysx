The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`) when checking the result of `strpos()`. This will correctly handle the case where the needle is found at the beginning of the haystack.

```php
$haystack = 'This is a test string.';
$needle = 'test';

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) === 0) {
    echo 'Needle found at the beginning!';
} else {
    echo 'Needle not found at the beginning.';
}
```

By using strict comparison, `false` will no longer be equal to 0, preventing the false positive.  The code will now accurately report whether the needle is present at the beginning of the string.
